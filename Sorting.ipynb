        "* Sorting refers to ordering data in an increasing or decreasing manner according to some **linear relationship** among the data items.\n",
        "* The opposite of sorting is called **shuffling**.\n",

        "## Why do we sort?\n",
        "*    To make searching faster\n",
        "*    To make merging of sequences faster\n",
        "*    To enable processing data in desired order\n",
        "\n",
        "## Terms\n",
        "*   **Key** - a property of an element by which sorting algorithm decideds the order of the elements\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Comparator - Binary Predicate\n",
        "*    Comparator is a function which is used to compare two elements.\n",
        "*    Comparator function will compare two elements and return the result\n",
        "*    There can be three possible outcomes (**>,<,=**) when we do the comparision and comparator function can return a **binary** value indicating **>** or **<**.\n",
        "*    Because if the **two elements are same** we have to **do noting** while sorting. So We only need to care whether the elements are **>** or **<**.\n",

        "### Adaptivity - Adaptive and Non Adaptive sorting algorithms\n",
        "*   A sorting algorithm is said to be adaptive if its **performance depends on the input data**. For example, if the input data is already sorted, an adaptive sorting algorithm will be able to sort it much faster than if the input data is completely random.\n",

Here the anomaly is with the Paper. If Paper is more powerful than the rock then how come Paper can be less powerful than the scissor.

        "Below you can see the code for the inefficient selection sort. Why it is inefficient? Ideally in selection sort for each iteration of the parent loop , an element will be in it's correct position. So the innerloop will start from **j+1** instead of **j**. But in our inefficient selection sort we cannot guarantee that for each iteration of the parent loop an element will be in it's correct position. Because **instead of skipping** the sorted portion of the array , we are always starting from **j = 0**. Eventhough it is inefficient it works. But we need to understand **why** it works. There are lots of nuances to the problem. When we do the swaps some interesting things happen."
