# GDB
Gdb is a debugger used to debug programs at run time.

## Debugging Information 
* We have to include debugging information inside our compiled binary output so that gdb can interpret them and set break points on them. 
* To include debugging information we have to have give **-g** flag to the gcc compiler.

### Most used commands
* To run **gdb program_name**
* To set breakpoint **gdb b(reak)** _<function_name or filename:line# or *memory address>_
*
